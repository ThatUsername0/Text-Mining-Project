The One with the Unexpected Engagement

[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch, looking through a vacation brochure.]

Monica: This resort looks amazing. It’s all-inclusive, has a spa, and they even have cooking classes!

Chandler: Cooking classes? That’s exactly what I need on vacation—to be reminded of how much better you are at cooking than me.

Monica: (laughs) Oh, come on, it’ll be fun. Besides, we need this vacation to relax and get away from everything.

Chandler: You mean, get away from Joey eating all our food and Rachel stealing your clothes?

Monica: Exactly! (pauses) But seriously, Chandler, we need to make a decision soon. They have limited spots available.

Chandler: Okay, let’s do it. (grins) We could use a break from the madness.

[Scene: Central Perk. Ross and Rachel are sitting on the couch, talking.]

Ross: So, I was thinking about taking Ben to the dinosaur museum this weekend. Want to join us?

Rachel: Oh, that sounds great! I think Emma would love it too. She’s been obsessed with dinosaurs lately.

Ross: (smiling) Just like her dad.

Rachel: (laughs) Exactly. Oh, by the way, have you heard from Joey? He said he had some big news to share.

Ross: No, but knowing Joey, it’s probably about food or a new role.

Rachel: (smirking) Or both.

[Scene: Joey’s Apartment. Joey is pacing around nervously. Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Hey Joey! What’s with the pacing? Did you lose another sandwich?

Joey: No, Pheebs. I’ve got something serious to talk about.

Phoebe: (concerned) What is it? You didn’t get another cat, did you?

Joey: No, no cats. (takes a deep breath) I’m thinking about proposing to my girlfriend.

Phoebe: (shocked) Wow! Joey Tribbiani, proposing? That’s huge!

Joey: I know! But I’m nervous. What if she says no?

Phoebe: Don’t be silly, Joey. You’re an amazing guy. She’s lucky to have you.

Joey: Thanks, Pheebs. I just want everything to be perfect.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Chandler is on the phone with the travel agent.]

Chandler: Yes, we’d like to book the honeymoon suite. (pauses) No, we’re not newlyweds, but we like to pretend. (laughs)

Monica: (mouthing) What’s going on?

Chandler: (covers phone) I’m booking us the honeymoon suite. We deserve a little luxury. (winks)

Monica: (smiling) I love you.

Chandler: (back on the phone) Yes, we’ll take it. Thank you. (hangs up) It’s done. We’re going to have an amazing time.

Monica: (hugs Chandler) This is going to be perfect. Just the two of us, relaxing and enjoying each other’s company.

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around a table.]

Joey: Guys, I have some news.

Rachel: Spill it, Joey. The suspense is killing me.

Joey: (nervously) I’m going to propose to my girlfriend.

Ross: (surprised) Joey, that’s great! Congratulations!

Phoebe: (excited) Oh my God, Joey! That’s amazing!

Rachel: Do you have a ring yet?

Joey: (nods) Yeah, I bought it yesterday. (pulls out a ring box and opens it)

Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross: (gasp) It’s beautiful!

Joey: Thanks. I just hope she likes it.

Rachel: She’s going to love it, Joey. Trust me.

Ross: When are you going to pop the question?

Joey: Tonight, at dinner. I wanted you guys to be the first to know.

Phoebe: (teary-eyed) Our Joey is growing up!

[Scene: Fancy Restaurant. Joey is sitting across from his girlfriend, nervously fidgeting with the ring box in his pocket.]

Girlfriend: Joey, are you okay? You seem a little on edge.

Joey: (nervously) I’m fine. Just, uh, thinking about how much I love you.

Girlfriend: (smiling) I love you too, Joey.

Joey: (taking a deep breath, getting down on one knee) I… I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?

Girlfriend: (shocked and teary-eyed) Yes! Yes, Joey, I will marry you!

Joey: (slipping the ring on her finger) You’ve made me the happiest man in the world.

[The restaurant patrons clap and cheer.]

[Scene: Central Perk. The group is gathered around, celebrating Joey’s engagement.]

Monica: Joey, we’re so happy for you!

Chandler: Yeah, who would’ve thought Joey Tribbiani would be the first to get engaged out of all of us?

Rachel: (teasing) Well, Ross beat him to it. Several times.

Ross: (laughs) Very funny.

Phoebe: This calls for a celebration. Let’s have a party!

Joey: (grinning) I couldn’t agree more. Thanks, guys. You’re the best.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Monica and Chandler are packing for their vacation.]

Monica: I can’t believe Joey’s getting married. Everything is changing.

Chandler: Yeah, but it’s a good change. We’re all moving forward.

Monica: (smiling) And we’re going to have an amazing vacation. Just the two of us.

Chandler: (hugging Monica) I can’t wait.

[They kiss as the screen fades to black.]
