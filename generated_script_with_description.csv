"The One with the Unexpected Engagement Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch, looking through a vacation brochure.] This resort looks amazing. It’s all-inclusive, has a spa, and they even have cooking classes! Cooking classes? That’s exactly what I need on vacation—to be reminded of how much better you are at cooking than me. Oh, come on, it’ll be fun. Besides, we need this vacation to relax and get away from everything. You mean, get away from Joey eating all our food and Rachel stealing your clothes? Exactly!  But seriously, Chandler, we need to make a decision soon. They have limited spots available. Okay, let’s do it.  We could use a break from the madness. Central Perk. Ross and Rachel are sitting on the couch, talking.] So, I was thinking about taking Ben to the dinosaur museum this weekend. Want to join us? Oh, that sounds great! I think Emma would love it too. She’s been obsessed with dinosaurs lately. Just like her dad. Exactly. Oh, by the way, have you heard from Joey? He said he had some big news to share. No, but knowing Joey, it’s probably about food or a new role. Or both. Joey’s Apartment. Joey is pacing around nervously. Phoebe enters.] Hey Joey! What’s with the pacing? Did you lose another sandwich? No, Pheebs. I’ve got something serious to talk about. What is it? You didn’t get another cat, did you? No, no cats.  I’m thinking about proposing to my girlfriend. Wow! Joey Tribbiani, proposing? That’s huge! I know! But I’m nervous. What if she says no? Don’t be silly, Joey. You’re an amazing guy. She’s lucky to have you. Thanks, Pheebs. I just want everything to be perfect. Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Chandler is on the phone with the travel agent.] Yes, we’d like to book the honeymoon suite.  No, we’re not newlyweds, but we like to pretend. What’s going on? I’m booking us the honeymoon suite. We deserve a little luxury. I love you. Yes, we’ll take it. Thank you.  It’s done. We’re going to have an amazing time. This is going to be perfect. Just the two of us, relaxing and enjoying each other’s company. Central Perk. Joey, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around a table.] Guys, I have some news. Spill it, Joey. The suspense is killing me. I’m going to propose to my girlfriend. Joey, that’s great! Congratulations! Oh my God, Joey! That’s amazing! Do you have a ring yet? Yeah, I bought it yesterday. It’s beautiful! Thanks. I just hope she likes it. She’s going to love it, Joey. Trust me. When are you going to pop the question? Tonight, at dinner. I wanted you guys to be the first to know. Our Joey is growing up! Fancy Restaurant. Joey is sitting across from his girlfriend, nervously fidgeting with the ring box in his pocket.] Joey, are you okay? You seem a little on edge. I’m fine. Just, uh, thinking about how much I love you. I love you too, Joey. I… I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes! Yes, Joey, I will marry you! You’ve made me the happiest man in the world. [The restaurant patrons clap and cheer.] Central Perk. The group is gathered around, celebrating Joey’s engagement.] Joey, we’re so happy for you! Yeah, who would’ve thought Joey Tribbiani would be the first to get engaged out of all of us? Well, Ross beat him to it. Several times. Very funny. This calls for a celebration. Let’s have a party! I couldn’t agree more. Thanks, guys. You’re the best. Monica and Chandler’s Apartment. Monica and Chandler are packing for their vacation.] I can’t believe Joey’s getting married. Everything is changing. Yeah, but it’s a good change. We’re all moving forward. And we’re going to have an amazing vacation. Just the two of us. I can’t wait. [They kiss as the screen fades to black.] End Credits.","suite. Monica and Chandler’s Apartment.
